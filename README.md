# Google Maps Boilerplate
The purpose of the Google Maps Boilerplate is to provide a functioning Google Map that has all the standard functions one would expect when creating a map from an API get call.

The map functions are in the `map.js` file. Each line has been commented to explain each function. The script is setup to pull data from the `sample-data.json` and can place markers on the map with and without lat/long coordinates.
